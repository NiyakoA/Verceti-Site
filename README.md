# Verceti-Site

## 📄 Overview  
Verceti-Site is a web project (built in TypeScript / JavaScript / CSS) that serves as the front-end for the “verceti-store”. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing, viewing, and interacting with store content.  

## 🚀 Why Verceti-Site?  
Many store/front-end templates are overly generic or heavyweight. Verceti-Site delivers a lightweight, clean, and modern codebase for building a customized store UI — ideal if you want full control over styling and behavior without bloated dependencies.  

## ✅ Features (or What It Does)  
- Built with TypeScript (majority of code) for type safety and maintainability.  
- Clean separation of code (JS/TS) and styling (CSS).  
- Simple, extensible folder structure (`verceti-store`, etc.) to help you customize/store your store.  
- Ready for further customization — easy to extend or integrate with a backend or API.
